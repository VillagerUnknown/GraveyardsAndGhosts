# VillagerUnknown's Graveyards & Ghosts

Inspired by MMORPG's, this mod adds graveyards to the world generation and optionally changes the respawn system so that players become ghosts when they die and respawn at the nearest graveyard.

**Features:**

* "Ghost" status effect.
* Graveyard respawn system.
* Custom structures.
* Custom blocks using vanilla ingredients for players to design their own graveyards.
* Groundskeeper villager trading Tombstones, Pedestals, Statues, Coffins, and Resurrection Statues.
* Players can join the world as Ghosts. This can be changed in the settings. (Players used to start as ghosts in v1.0.0)
* Ghosts can respawn at their last death location or any Resurrection Statue (Graveyard).
* Graveyards generate in the Overworld and End dimensions.
* Beds no longer act as spawn points but still pass the night.
* Respawn anchors still work in the Nether.

**"Ghost" Status Effect**

With the Ghost effect applied players are invisible, can fly, take no damage, lose no saturation, and can only interact with certain objects in the world like doors, buttons, levers, etc. They cannot break or place blocks. Ghosts can still use fishing rods and ender pearls.

A Ghost potion can be brewed by brewing a Totem of Undying with an Awkward Potion. Splash potions and tipped arrows can be crafted in their usual fashion. These items are still experimental.

**Graveyard Respawn System**

* As a player explores the world they will discover graveyards.
* When a player dies they will respawn at the nearest discovered graveyard with the Ghost effect applied to them.
* If a player dies in a dimension where they have not discovered a graveyard, they will respawn at an Overworld graveyard closest to the portal they used to go to the dimension they died in.
* Ghosts can choose to find their corpse to respawn or safely respawn at a graveyard.
* A prompt to resurrect will be displayed when a ghost is near their corpse.
* Ghosts can interact (right-click) on resurrection statues and respawn anchors to resurrect.
* Respawn anchors must be charged and interacted with to become a possible respawn point.
* Respawn anchors still require a charge to act as a respawn point for ghosts.
* Beds no longer act as spawn points but still pass the night.

**Custom Structures**

* **Graveyards** - Graveyards spawn in the Overworld and End dimensions. They act as respawn points and can provide risky looting opportunities.

**Custom Block Types**

* **Resurrection Statues** - The centerpiece of every Graveyard, the resurrection statue can be crafted in the crafting bench with a Totem of Undying and the desired statue material. 
It will act as a respawn point for ghosts. Ghosts can interact with the statue to resurrect.
* **Coffins** - A chest-like block that when disturbed has a chance of spawning an undead mob. Are the treasures inside worth the risk? Coffins can be crafted in the crafting table with a Chest and the desired statue material.
* **Grave Soil** - A dirt-like block that when disturbed has a chance of spawning an undead mob. Grave soil will not drop it's item form, cannot be crafted, and has a chance of dropping loot when broken. Be respectful of the dead and watch your step or pay the consequences!
* **Statues** - Aesthetic statues including generic statues, player statues, villager statues, pillager statues, piglin statues, and dragon-inspired statues. All statues can be crafted with a stonecutter.
* **Pedestals** - Basic cut blocks to hold statues that can be crafted with a stonecutter.
* **Tombstones** - Various grave markers including flat, rounded, and broken tombstones. Use silk touch on tombstones if you don't want their broken form. All tombstones can be crafted with a stonecutter. (In the future I hope to be able to make tombstones similar to signs where players can edit and place text on them.)

**Groundskeeper Villager**

* Groundskeeper villagers use Resurrection Statues as workstations.
* Groundskeeper villagers trade Tombstones (level 1), Pedestals (level 2), Statues (level 3), Coffins (level 4), and Resurrection Statues (level 5).
